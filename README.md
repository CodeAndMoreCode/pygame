# pygame
Repository for my Pygame projects with Python.

In the archived file are included all needed files for running the game.
In the archived file it is included and the source ".py" file itself although there is a source file outside of the ".rar" file.
The reason why uploaded the lonely source file is for the folks who search for something or to review the source quickly so to do not waste time.
